📊 Employee Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting employee salaries using machine learning techniques. By analyzing factors such as experience, education, department, and job role, the model helps organizations make data-driven salary decisions.

The project demonstrates the complete data science lifecycle — from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model building and evaluation.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze employee data to understand salary trends

Perform data cleaning and feature engineering

Build machine learning models for salary prediction

Compare model performance and select the best one

# 📊 Employee Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts employee salaries using machine learning techniques based on factors such as experience, education, job role, and department. It demonstrates the complete data science workflow, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training and evaluation.

The project is implemented as a single Python file and executed using VS Code.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze employee data to identify key factors affecting salary  
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Build and compare machine learning models  
- Predict employee salaries with high accuracy  

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- Age  
- Education Level  
- Job Role  
- Department  
- Years of Experience  
- Monthly Salary  

**Format:** CSV (sample data is also created within the Python file)  
**Source:** Kaggle / HR Dataset
